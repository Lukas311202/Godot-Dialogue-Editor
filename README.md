# Godot-Dialogue-Editor A branching Dialogue System for Games made in the Godot Engine

inspired by the Dialogic plugin from https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic

The System contains a Graph Editor for creating branching dialogue files, a basic ui for displaying it and a simple character editor.
The created Dialogue and character files are json files and can be used in other Game Engines that support json.
This plugin also includes a npc scheme file, this file basicly says which information the npcs hold such as name, introduction dialogue, trading dialogue and whatever else your game needs

Creating new Nodes
This plugin comes with basic nodes such as conversation,question, signal nodes, etc, if you personally something you can easily add your own nodes
